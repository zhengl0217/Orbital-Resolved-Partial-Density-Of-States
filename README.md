# Python utility function for orbital-resolved partial density of states 

This repository contains a python file, named as **pdos**, for extracting the orbital-resolved partial density of states from [Materials Project](https://www.materialsproject.org/) database. The current [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/) module built on top of the Materials Project only supports the query of the total electron density of states and the orbital-resolved partial density of states are missing. This oython utility function that dependent on the pymatgen module will help the researchers to have a more comprehensive understanding to the electronic structures of materials.
