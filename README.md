# Feature Engineering for Perovskite's Electronic Structure Properties 

This repository contains python code and raw data to reproduce the results in the paper "An Adaptive Machine Learning Strategy for Accelerating Discovery of Perovskite Electrocatalysts", by Zheng Li, Luke E. Achenie, and Hongliang Xin. The python file named "density_state_descriptor.py" includes all the feature functions for the electronic density of states that are calculated by density functional theory (DFT). The file named "compositional_descriptor.py" contains descriptor functions based on atomic properties in the perovskite structure. 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' contain all the data that are used for model training and model prediction.

Right now, we’re in your first GitHub **repository**. A repository is like a folder or storage space for your project. Your project's repository contains all its files such as code, documentation, images, and more. It also tracks every change that you—or your collaborators—make to each file, so you can always go back to previous versions of your project if you make any mistakes.

This repository contains three important files: The HTML code for your first website on GitHub, the CSS stylesheet that decorates your website with colors and fonts, and the **README** file. It also contains an image folder, with one image file.

They are written in plain text or [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and usually include a paragraph describing the project, directions on how to use it, who authored it, and more.
