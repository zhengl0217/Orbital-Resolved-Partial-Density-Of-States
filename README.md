# Python utility function for orbital-resolved partial density of states 

This repository contains a python code for extracting the orbital-resolved partial density of states from [Materials Project](https://www.materialsproject.org/) database. 

Right now, we’re in your first GitHub **repository**. A repository is like a folder or storage space for your project. Your project's repository contains all its files such as code, documentation, images, and more. It also tracks every change that you—or your collaborators—make to each file, so you can always go back to previous versions of your project if you make any mistakes.

This repository contains three important files: The HTML code for your first website on GitHub, the CSS stylesheet that decorates your website with colors and fonts, and the **README** file. It also contains an image folder, with one image file.

They are written in plain text or [Materials Project](https://www.materialsproject.org/), and usually include a paragraph describing the project, directions on how to use it, who authored it, and more.
